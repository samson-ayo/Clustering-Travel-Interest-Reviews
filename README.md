# Clustering-Travel-Interest-Reviews

People love traveling to various places of interest, but sometimes, the question of where to
visit arises. There are places of interest that match peopleâ€™s lifestyles where they would often
spend time without regretting their visit. Using the travel reviews dataset, we aim to divide
users into clusters of similar interests using their feedback rating information about different
destinations across East Asia. The machine learning algorithm to be employed for this project
is unsupervised learning which is Clustering.
